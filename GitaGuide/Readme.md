# GitaGuide - Ancient Wisdom for Modern Dilemmas

An iOS app that transforms the timeless wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita into practical guidance for daily life decisions.

## üìñ Project Origin

This project was conceived from a conversation about creating an app that helps people navigate the eternal human conflict between emotion and duty, personal attachment and righteous action - the central theme of Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1.

### The Conversation

**Initial Concept**: Create an iOS app based on Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1 (Arjuna's Dilemma) that provides practical guidance for modern life scenarios where people face conflicts between heart and duty.

**Core Insight**: Arjuna's dilemma on the battlefield represents universal human struggles - workplace ethics, family obligations, friendship boundaries, moral courage, and personal integrity.

**Design Philosophy**: Use simple stick figure illustrations to make ancient wisdom approachable and non-intimidating, while providing actionable guidance for real-world situations.
